Add the *-fobjc-arc* compiler flag in the build phases tab if your project doesn't use ARC**.\r\n\r\n1. Copy the 'Harpy' folder into your Xcode project.\r\n1. Import **Harpy.h** into your AppDelegate or Pre-Compiler Header (.pch)\r\n1. In your `AppDelegate`, set the **appID**, and optionally, you can set the **alertType**.\r\n1. In your `AppDelegate`, call **only one** of the `checkVersion` methods, as all three perform a check on your application's first launch. Use either:\r\n    - `checkVersion` in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`\r\n    - `checkVersionDaily` in `applicationDidBecomeActive:`.\r\n    - `checkVersionWeekly` in `applicationDidBecomeActive:`.\r\n\t\r\n``` obj-c\r\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\r\n{\r\n\r\n\t// Present Window before calling Harpy\r\n\t[self.window makeKeyAndVisible]\r\n\t\r\n\t// Set the App ID for your app\r\n\t[[Harpy sharedInstance] setAppID:@\"<app_id>\"];\r\n\t\r\n\t/* (Optional) Set the Alert Type for your app \r\n\t By default, the Singleton is initialized to HarpyAlertTypeOption */\r\n\t[[Harpy sharedInstance] setAlertType:<alert_type>];\r\n\r\n\t/* (Optional) If your application is not availabe in the U.S. Store, you must specify the two\r\n           letter country code for the region in which your applicaiton is available in. */\r\n\t[[Harpy sharedInstance] setCountryCode:@\"<countryCode>\"]; \r\n\t\r\n\t// Perform check for new version of your app \r\n\t[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersion]; \r\n}\r\n\r\n- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application\r\n{\r\n\r\n\t/*\r\n\t Perform daily check for new version of your app\r\n\t Useful if user returns to you app from background after extended period of time\r\n \t Place in applicationDidBecomeActive:\r\n \t \r\n \t Also, performs version check on first launch.\r\n \t*/\r\n\t[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersionDaily];\r\n\r\n\t/*\r\n\t Perform weekly check for new version of your app\r\n\t Useful if user returns to you app from background after extended period of time\r\n\t Place in applicationDidBecomeActive:\r\n\t \r\n\t Also, performs version check on first launch.\r\n\t */\r\n\t[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersionWeekly];\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you're all set!\r\n\r\n### Optinonal Delegate and Delegate Methods\r\nIf you'd like to handle or track the end-user's behavior, four delegate methods have been made available to you:\r\n\r\n```\tobj-c\r\n\r\n\t// User presented with update dialog\r\n\t- (void)harpyDidShowUpdateDialog;\r\n\t\r\n\t// User did click on button that launched App Store.app\r\n\t- (void)harpyUserDidLaunchAppStore;\r\n\t\r\n\t// User did click on button that skips version update\r\n\t- (void)harpyUserDidSkipVersion;\r\n\t\r\n\t// User did click on button that cancels update dialog\r\n\t- (void)harpyUserDidCancel;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Important Note on AppStore Submissions\r\n- The AppStore reviewer will **not** see the alert. \r\n\r\n### Project Contributors\r\n- [Aaron Brager](http://www.github.com/getaaron) in v1.5.0\r\n- [Ercillagorka](https://github.com/ercillagorka) in v2.3.4\r\n- [Erick](https://github.com/dexcell0) in v2.3.3\r\n- [Claas Lange](https://github.com/claaslange) in v2.0.0\r\n- [David Keegan](https://github.com/kgn) in v2.3.0\r\n- [Jamie Ly](https://github.com/jamiely) in v2.3.6\r\n- [Josh T.
